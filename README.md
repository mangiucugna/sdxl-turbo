# A port of the official SDXL-Turbo demo

I was not too happy with the official demo, it was junky and full of warnings and it didn't run properly on my Mac M2 with 16Gb of RAM.

So I decided to fix the code and make it a bit nicer to play with.

**Tip:** If you want to modify an image, Increase strength and reduce the steps.
